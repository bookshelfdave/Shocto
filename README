REQUIREMENTS

Ruby 1.8 
  http://www.ruby-lang.org
  * Shocto depends on yaml, readline, abbrev, timeout and getoptlong
  which I believe are part of the standard installation. However, I
  noticed that on Ubuntu (5.04), I had to install each of these packages
  separately.


Ruby Gems
  http://docs.rubygems.org
  The user manual has installation instructions.
  I believe it's usually just a one command installation.

OpenSSH
  http://www.openssh.org

INSTALLATION
  sudo gem install Shocto-X.X.gem
  (where X.X is the version number)


RUNNING
  type:
  shocto

  During startup, shocto will try to create ~/.shocto and a defaults file.


Quick Start:
	To see how it works, try these commands while you are in shocto:
	
	help
	addgroup test
	(this will change you to the "test" working group)
	addserver apache@web1
	addserver apache@web2
	addserver apache@web3
	addserver apache@web4
	 
	exec uptime
	(this will try and run uptime on each server. If you don't have
	ssh keys setup, then you will be prompted for a password)

	copyid apache@web1
	(this will send your public ssh key over to the server, to allow
	you to connect without using a password. PLEASE SEE THE SSH DOCUMENTATION!)


	Here is how you add a command. You will be prompted for several params.
	addcommand
		diskspace
		Checks disk space in /opt
		df -k | grep /opt

	and then just type
		diskspace
	at the shocto prompt and the command will be run on all servers within
	the current group.


	Type save to save your group(s) and commands.

	More to come...
